## Greetings ðŸ‘‹, I am Ricardo :man_technologist:

I am an experienced Software Engineer who likes to take on complex challenges and continuously expand my knowledge of various programming languages and technologies. I strive to stay up-to-date with industry trends and best practices, always seeking opportunities to enhance my skill set.

In my early career, I worked as a consultant and project manager. As a result, I am a "developer that thinks like a  Product Manager", writing code that adapts to the broader context and business goals. Furthermore, this approach enables me to facilitate a shared understanding of requirements between developers and the business.

Above all, I prioritize continuously improving the codebases I work on, looking for ways to refactor, and seeking new libraries, frameworks and practices to integrate.
